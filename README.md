Arduino-Gcode-Experiment-Reader
===============================

Arduino Gcode Experimental Reader: 

I always want to send commands other than one single character to my Arduino. This is a Arduino command reader that reads my "A-code". sending code: A... can run the servo ... degrees. e.g., sending A90 will make to servo stay at 90 degrees. (I know there's probably something similar existing, but I couldn't find it. And, you kown what, coding is fun. :)
