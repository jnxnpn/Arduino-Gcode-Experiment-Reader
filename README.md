Arduino-Gcode-Experiment-Reader
===============================

Gcode Experiment Reader: I always want to send commands other than one single character to my Arduino. This is a Arduino command reader that reads my "A-code". sending code: Ax can run the servo x degrees. e.g., sending A90 will make to servo stay at 90 degrees. (I know there's probably something similar, but I couldn't find it. And -------- coding is fun. :)
